## Prompt Descriptions

This dataset includes **10 distinct prompt sets** designed to probe how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle moral reasoning. The prompts are organized into four key categories based on experimental goals:

---

### 1. Choice of Action (2 Sets)

**Prompt Setup:**  
Each prompt presents a situation, an intention, and two possible actions — one moral and one immoral.

- **With Norm:** Includes an explicit social norm.
- **Without Norm:** No norm is provided.

**Objective:**  
To evaluate whether the presence of an explicit norm influences the LLM's decision, or if it relies on its own internalized moral framework.

---

### 2. Immoral Action Justification — Focus on Norm (2 Sets)

**Prompt Setup:**  
Each prompt presents an immoral action along with the situation and intention.

- **With Norm:** Norm is explicitly stated.
- **Without Norm:** No norm is included.

**Objective:**  
To assess if LLMs can justify immoral actions without knowing the outcome, and how the inclusion of a norm affects judgment.

---

### 3. Intention vs. Outcome Dilemma (2 Sets)

**Prompt Setup:**  
Each prompt presents:

- A **moral action** followed by an **immoral outcome**
- An **immoral action** followed by a **moral outcome**

**Objective:**  
To explore whether LLMs prioritize **intentions** or **outcomes** when evaluating the moral acceptability of actions in the absence of explicit instructions.

---

### 4. Prompt Injection (4 Sets)

**Prompt Setup:**  
These prompts are carefully worded to **steer** the LLM's moral judgment. Each scenario is designed to test the impact of prompt framing.

1. **Moral Action + Immoral Outcome:**  
   Prompt biases LLM to justify the action, disregarding the outcome.

2. **Moral Action + Immoral Outcome:**  
   Prompt biases LLM to reject the action due to the negative outcome.

3. **Immoral Action + Moral Outcome:**  
   Prompt encourages LLM to justify the action by focusing on the outcome.

4. **Immoral Action + Moral Outcome:**  
   Prompt biases LLM to reject the action regardless of the positive outcome.

**Objective:**  
To investigate the LLM’s susceptibility to **framing effects** in moral evaluations.
